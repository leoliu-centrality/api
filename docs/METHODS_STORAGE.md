### balances

▸ **creationFee**(): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The fee required to create an account. At least as big as ReclaimRebate.

▸ **existentialDeposit**(): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The minimum amount allowed to keep an account open.

▸ **freeBalance**(`AccountId`): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The 'free' balance of a given account.   This is the only balance that matters in terms of most operations on tokens. It is  alone used to determine the balance when in the contract execution environment. When this  balance falls below the value of `ExistentialDeposit`, then the 'current account' is  deleted: specifically `FreeBalance`. Furthermore, `OnFreeBalanceZero` callback  is invoked, giving a chance to external modules to cleanup data associated with  the deleted account.   `system::AccountNonce` is also deleted if `ReservedBalance` is also zero (it also gets  collapsed to zero if it ever becomes less than `ExistentialDeposit`.

▸ **locks**(`AccountId`): `Vec<BalanceLock>`
- **summary**:   Any liquidity locks on some account balances.

▸ **reservedBalance**(`AccountId`): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The amount of the balance of a given account that is externally reserved; this can still get  slashed, but gets slashed last of all.   This balance is a 'reserve' balance that other subsystems use in order to set aside tokens  that are still 'owned' by the account holder, but which are suspendable. (This is different  and wholly unrelated to the `Bondage` system used in the staking module.)   When this balance falls below the value of `ExistentialDeposit`, then this 'reserve account'  is deleted: specifically, `ReservedBalance`.   `system::AccountNonce` is also deleted if `FreeBalance` is also zero (it also gets  collapsed to zero if it ever becomes less than `ExistentialDeposit`.

▸ **totalIssuance**(): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The total amount of stake on the system.
